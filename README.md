# HTTP_External_groovy
Due to using grails version 2.3.8, I was uanble to use latest HTTP builder APIs with groovy in my GRAILS project.
So that, I made my required GET and POST with the help of Java HttpURLConnection Class! 
The response jsonString is converted to jsonObject so that response can be easily parsed!
These included GET and POST functions perform really fast with proper checked exceptions! 
I was using external bank api called TINK! [Here I am not sharing the real clientIDs, clientSecrets and authCodes for privacy]
You can just pass the parameters on your own as required by your program!
